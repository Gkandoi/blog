## Background:
10
​
11
Donald Knuth is maybe best known for his work on TeX, which made LaTeX possible, which in turn is being used in (all?) scientific publications ranging from papers to monographs across disciplines.
12
​
13
In order to write TeX, Donald Knuth first invented `WEB`, a programming system that combines text and code.  This is the first system implementation of "literate programming". Derived from  `WEB` is `noweb` (by Norman Ramsey), which introduces the concept of inter`weaving` text and code chunks.
14
​
15
`Sweave` (Friedrich Leisch, 2002) is an R package that uses `noweb` to interweave LaTeX and S-code ... and that brings us finally to `knitr` (Yihui Xie, 2012--), which is the package behind RWeave and RMarkdown.
