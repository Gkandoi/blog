I am a LaTeX beginner and trying to using this to give homework solutions as a teaching assistance this term. I like the TeX program because it gives beautiful typesetting, especially for mathematical formulas.

As the speaker Donald Knuth said in this video, literate programming is written for human beings to read. It can produce high quality document and makes communication through papers more efficient and easier. And another advantage is it could give exactly the same document results on all computers for every people, this is important to spread the ideas precisely. I really appreciate Knuth's work especially when I need to write a document full of matrices and complex formulas, his program makes it easier to write a professional and readable article.
