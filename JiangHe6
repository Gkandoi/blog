Regard the code below and describe in what way(s) the idea of functional programming makes code easier to write and maintain.

```
x <- 1:10
funs <- list(
  sum = sum,
  mean = mean,
  median = median
)
lapply(funs, function(f) f(x, na.rm=TRUE))
```

After reading "functional programming", I am excited to apply that into my coding in R. The big takeaway for me is by doing that, there will be less repetition and error. For example above, a list of functions (sum, mean and median) are created at once all together. By doing that, so it's easier to make a change within that list, and call that function later in other places without change a thing. 
Also,a simple anonymous function f is used in the lapply function to apply the created function to all elements in vector x. We don't care about the name or structure of that function, so being able to write a function without name or certain structure in R is unique and convenient.
