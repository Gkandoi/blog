## Background:

Read the paper [A layered grammar of graphics](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d779/6f85dabccd18673f382c100fc06f55e8b501.pdf) by Hadley Wickham (*Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, 19(1), 2010, 3-28.)


Write a blog post addressing the question: *How does having a grammar help with creating charts?*

## Why a grammar is important.

There are two main reasons why having a grammar is important in creating charts.  The first, and the most important, is that it is easy to write any code to produce the charts or graph that you like.  For example, using ggplot2, all commands are separated by a plus, so it is easy to put in a new command to add something extra to the charts.
