# Explain how a user can define a new S3 class with objects and methods at a small example of your choice. 

There are two common steps when it comes to define a new S3 class: creating  objects and defining methods. Two ways to create a object: using the command class(x); another way is to use a constructor function. Then, I can use UseMethod() to use the generic methods or define new methods. 

An example: 
### create an object: 
veggie1 <- list("Broccoli", "Celery", "Spinach")
###  assign an existing object a class
class(veggie1) <- "like"  
peference <- function(x){
  UseMethod(print("I like those vegetables!"))
}
