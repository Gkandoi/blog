##  What are intervals, durations, periods, and instants?

An instant is like a moment or specific moment in time. An interval is a span of time that occurs between two specific instants that means it can never be ambiguous. A duration is a time length that has exact length like seconds. On the other hand, the non-exact time is called period. Periods measures time units greater than seconds like minutes, hours etc.


## (Why) do we need these distinctions?
Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post!

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository!
