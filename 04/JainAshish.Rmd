- (Why) do we need these distinctions?

##Date and time

In order to carry out a number of arithmatic operations with time data, a number of time related data objects has been supported by lubridate.

####Instants
When we capture a specific moment of time, it is called as instant. For example, 14th Feburary 2017, when we parse this into date in R, it will create an instant. It is basically a data type to store a particular moment in time. In `lubridate` package,  does not create a new class for instant objects. Instead, it recognizes any date-time object that refers to a moment of time as an instant.

####Intervals
In order to store a duration of time between two instants, intervals are used.

####Durations

####Periods
