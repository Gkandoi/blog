Out of the two options for this blog post, I have decided to focus on the second one:  

## Explain how a user can define a new S3 class with objects and methods at a small example of your choice.  

I will define a new S3 class with objects and methods 
```{r}
Pets <- function(isMammal=TRUE,animalType="hedgehog",breedType="African Pygmy")
{
        me <- list(
                hasBabies = isMammal,
                petType = animalType
       )
        class(me) <- append(class(me),"Pets")
        return(me)
}
```
Now that we have created this class, we can create new objects of this class by calling the function we have created. I will define two different pets using this class function.

```{r}
Obi <- Pets()
Obi

Oslo <- Pets(isMammal=TRUE, animalType="dog", breedType="Poochon")
Oslo
```
