## Experience in writing an R package:

Lab 5 of this class was my first time experiencing writing an R package, and I must say it was a very interesting experience.  Writing the functions themselves were the easy parts, as I have experience writing functions in R.  However, the main difficulty of this was finding the right was to save and load the data files needed in the package.  The data file we originally downloaded from the web was saved as a different name than what we used to save as a ```{r}.Rda``` file in the package folder.  Definitely some snags came up when trying to use the file as used in the package, as we were not able to grab the right file.  After discussion, we realized the ```{r}.Rda``` and the file we were using ```{r} save() ```
